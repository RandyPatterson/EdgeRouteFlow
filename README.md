## Blog Post

This website is based on my [blog post](https://sandervandevelde.wordpress.com/2019/01/25/visualize-azure-iot-edge-device-routes-as-a-flowchart-in-asp-net-mvc/). 

## Disclaimer

This site does not save input data, it does not track users. There are no ads. Just enjoy Azure IoT Edge and the flow charts of your routes.

I activated HTTPS to project your connectionstrings.

But still be smart, do never expose your production connection strings outside Azure!
